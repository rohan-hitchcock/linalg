A package for doing linear algebra in numpy. 


# Components
* `core.py`: contains core linear algebra operations such as algorithms for row reducing, orthogonalization, etc. 
* `hyperplane.py`: defines the Hyperplane class, which represents affine hyperplanes
* `exotic.py`: contains other linear algebra algorithms.
